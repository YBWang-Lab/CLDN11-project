In this study, we collected nineteen hippocampus samples from HS patients to generate snRNA-seq profiles. Four public human single-nucleus data of control hippocampus samples obtained from the GEO database (GSE163737) were integrated and analyzed together with our data.
The single-nucleus RNA-seq data of four hippocampus samples of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients were from the GEO database (GSE216877).
The single-cell RNA seq data of five temporal neocortex samples of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients were from the GEO database (GSE140393).
